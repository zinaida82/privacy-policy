Privacy Policy for FAISS Knowledge Retrieval API

Last Updated: [19.02.2025]
1. Introduction
Welcome to the FAISS Knowledge Retrieval API. This API allows users to search for structured knowledge stored in a FAISS-based vector database. We take privacy and data security seriously and want to clarify how user queries are handled.

2. Data Collection & Storage
The FAISS API does not store, log, or retain any user queries.
All searches are processed in real-time and are not saved after execution.
No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored.

3. Data Security
The FAISS index operates locally on the user's machine or server.
Queries are processed in memory and are not recorded.
We do not share, sell, or distribute any user data.

4. Third-Party Services
If you are using ngrok to expose the FAISS API externally, note that ngrok may log connection metadata (IP, request time).
We do not control external service logging policies.

5. User Responsibility
Users are responsible for ensuring their API keys and endpoints are secure.
If deploying in production, it is recommended to use a proper WSGI server like Gunicorn instead of Flaskâ€™s development server.
